            <h2>Lillet Blanc</h2>
            <h3>Podensac, Graves</h3>
            <p>Lillet, originally known as Kina Lillet, was founded in 1872 as Bordeaux's first and only aperitif. 
                Lillet, as it became known in the 1970s, is produced in Podensac, Graves and is a blend of 85-percent 
                Bordeaux regional wines and 15-percent handcrafted fruit liqueurs.</p>
            <p>The original Kina Lillet was produced with quinine liqueur, sourced from the bark of the Cinchona tree 
                of Peru. It was replaced in 1986, with the Lillet Blanc, a sweeter version with a milder quinine profile 
                to suit a broader range of consumers.</p>
            <p>Lillet Blanc is a medium color white wine aperitif, made from Sauvignon Blanc and Semillon 
                grapes. The nose is of honey and orange and a hint of mint. While the nose may lead you to expect 
                a sweet dessert wine, in fact Lillet Blanc leads with a taste of firm bitterness, which suddenly diminishes, 
                leaving a lingering trace of orange, honey and herbaceousness on the palate.</p>
