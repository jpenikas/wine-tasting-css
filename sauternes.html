            <h2>Sauternes</h2>
            <h3>Graves, Left Bank</h3>
            <p>Sweet and unctuous but delightfully charming, the finest Sauternes typically express flavors 
            of exotic dried tropical fruit, candied apricot, dried citrus peel, honey or ginger and a zesty 
            beam of acidity.</p>
            <p>Sémillon, Sauvignon Blanc, Sauvignon Gris and Muscadelle are the grapes of Sauternes. But Sémillon's 
            susceptibility to the requisite noble rot makes it the main variety and contributor to what makes 
            Sauternes so unique. As a result, most Sauternes estates are planted to about 80% Sémillon. Sauvignon 
            is prized for its balancing acidity and Muscadelle adds aromatic complexity to the blend with Sémillon.</p>
            <p>Botrytis cinerea or “noble rot” is a fungus that grows on grapes only in specific conditions and its 
            onset is crucial to the development of the most stunning of sweet wines.</p>
            <p>In the fall, evening mists develop along the Garonne River, and settle into the small Sauternes 
            district, creeping into the vineyards and sitting low until late morning. The next day, the sun 
            has a chance to burn the moisture away, drying the grapes and concentrating their sugars and phenolic 
            qualities. What distinguishes a fine Sauternes from a normal one is the producer’s willingness to wait 
            and tend to the delicate botrytis-infected grapes through the end of the season.</p>
            <h3>Chateau Villefranche</h3>
            <p>Château Villefranche is recognised as one of the oldest wine estates in the Sauternes region. 
                It has been in the Guinabert family since the mid XVII century. The estate extends over to the 
                Haut-Barsac plateau with its rich argilo-calcareous (clay and limestone) soil types.</p>
