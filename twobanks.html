                        <th>Grape Varieties</th>
                        <td>Cabernet Sauvignon dominates this bank. Most blends are made primarily from Cabernet Sauvignon, with a smaller percentage of Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Some producers also include a touch of Petit Verdot, Malbec, or Carménère Producers like Haut-Brion, Margaux, Palmer, Lynch-Bages, and Mouton-Rothschild also craft white wine blends, although these are less common compared to red blends. </td>
                        <td>Merlot is the primary variety in the Right Bank, and most red blends contain a smaller percentage of Cabernet Franc, sometimes supported by Cabernet Sauvignon and, less commonly, Malbec, and Petit Verdot.</td>

                    <tr>
                        <th>Soil</th>
                        <td>Gravel in the soil means that the vine roots are well-drained and must extend farther into the ground to access the water table. This puts a fair amount of stress on the vines. However, this stress results in smaller, more concentrated, and more complex-tasting grapes.</td>
                        <td>The soil in the Right Bank is rich in clay and limestone. The rocky limestone topsoil drains water from the surface quickly while the heavier clay beneath helps retain some of this water deep underground, providing moisture for the vine during hot summer months or periods of little rain.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Climate</th>
                        <td>The Left Bank is slightly cooler than the Right Bank, allowing the grapes to develop a great deal of acidity. This also improves the wine’s aging potential.</td>
                        <td>Because the Right Bank is sheltered from oceanic winds, it’s typically warmer than the Left Bank during the summer. This produces grapes that taste very ripe and are lower in acidity than Left Bank grapes. However, the Right Bank is also more prone to frost in the early spring, and this can have an impact on yields.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Flavor Profile</th>
                        <td>Because the grapes are concentrated and high in both acidity and tannin, wines from the Left Bank taste complex and powerful. Due to their tannic nature, they can be unapproachable in their youth, but after a few years of cellaring, the wines’ tannins relax and become rounder in character.</td>
                        <td>The wines of the Right Bank are generally smooth, rich, and easy to drink when they’re young. The grapes usually ripen fully under the warm summer conditions and some of these wines are fairly fruit-forward as a result. However, that doesn’t mean that they lack complexity; while some Right Bank blends are simple in structure, many others are very aromatic and develop complex, mature flavors as they age. Producers who craft the most complex Right Bank wines include Pétrus, Cheval Blanc, and Le Pin.</td>
