                Famous for both its red and white wines, Graves is a large region, extending 30 miles southeast of the city of 
                Bordeaux, along the left bank of the Garonne River. Red wine producing vineyards cover well over three times as 
                much area as the whites. In the late 1980s, the French created the separate appellation of Pessac-LÃ©ognan within 
                the northern confines of Graves. It includes all of its most famous properties, and the southern suburbs of the 
                city Bordeaux itself. In French "graves" is a term used to indicate gravelly soils.

                The typical Graves white is dry, mid-bodied and usually made from the equally familiar combination of Sauvignon 
                Blanc and Semillon. Around 2500 hectares (6200 acres) of Graves AOC vineyards are devoted to red wine grape 
                varieties, with approximately 750ha (1850 acres) planted with white grapes.

                The Graville-Lacoste property produces a Graves Blanc, known primarily for its stony soil composition and fresh 
                minerality. This wine is different from many others from the appellation because of its high proportion of Semillon.
                It is a blend of 75% Semillon, 20% Sauvignon Blanc, and 5% Muscadelle aged in stainless steel.
